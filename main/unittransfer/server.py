"""Local web server for the Unit Transfer UI (Stage 4).

Serves a single-page app to browse a source mod's units faction-wise (with icons),
pick a destination mod, and transfer units with options + conflict resolution.
Transfers apply in-place into the destination mod (backing up first) and every
transfer is logged with an undo.

API
  GET  /                         -> SPA

  POST /api/port/plan | /apply   -> copy them over: the block, the triggers that
                                    grant it and its text keys, in one backed-up,
                                    undoable job. See :mod:`unittransfer.portrecords`
  POST /api/m2ex                 -> {mod[, on]} -> {m2ex}. Whether the mod runs on
                                    M2EX, which replaces the engine's hardcoded
                                    ceilings - so the toolkit stops reporting
                                    them. See :mod:`unittransfer.modflags`
  POST /api/browse_folder        -> {title} -> {path}  (native OS folder dialog)

                                    /icon or /building_icon URL is, where a
                                    replacement lands, and every warning about it
                                    (resolution mismatch above all)
  POST /api/image/replace        -> the same, applied - backups + undo included
  POST /api/image/reveal         -> "Open file location" for that same URL, which
                                    can land outside the mod when the art is the
                                    game's own
  GET  /api/mods                 -> [{name, root, pack}]  (scanned under

                                    importing is then an ordinary transfer out of
                                    it, with every check that implies

                                    it uses, plus a tally per skeleton - what the

                                    identically into several faction folders, and
                                    the sets that really do differ per faction
  POST /api/cards/plan | /apply  -> remove them, or fold them into the merc folder

Sprites mode (far-LOD unit sprites, see :mod:`unittransfer.sprites`)
  GET  /api/sprites?mod=         -> models, CFG state, what's waiting in export/,
                                    and an audit of the modeldb's sprite lines
  POST /api/sprites/prep_plan    -> what prepping generation would touch
  POST /api/sprites/prep_apply   -> write sprite_script.txt / CFG flag (or the
                                    M2TWEOP console snippet, which writes nothing)

                                    actually has, with size + encoding, plus the
                                    campaign's in-game name

Triggers (the shared builder's vocabulary, see :mod:`unittransfer.triggers`)
  GET  /api/triggers/vocab?mod=  -> every engine condition and event, with what
                                    each condition REQUIRES and each event
                                    EXPORTS, plus this mod's own trait /

                                    names for the operand pickers

Traits mode (export_descr_character_traits.txt, see :mod:`unittransfer.traits`)
  GET  /api/traits?mod=          -> every trait, light: levels, thresholds, how
                                    many triggers feed it, how many findings
  GET  /api/trait?mod=&name=     -> one trait in full: header, levels, effects,
                                    its text keys, and the triggers that give it
  POST /api/traits/plan|/apply   -> add, edit or delete a trait and the triggers
                                    that feed it, adding any missing

  GET  /icon?mod=&kind=ancillary&image=
                                 -> that ancillary's picture as a PNG

Factions mode (descr_sm_factions.txt, see :mod:`unittransfer.factions`)
  GET  /api/factions?mod=        -> every faction, light: culture, religion, its
                                    two map colours, horde size, findings
  GET  /api/faction?mod=&name=   -> one in full: every line, the pickers its
                                    boxes need, and its expanded.txt name
  POST /api/factions/clone_plan|/clone_apply
                                 -> ADD a faction, by cloning one that already
                                    works into all twelve files that name a slot
                                    plus its art (backups + undo, one id for the
                                    lot). See :mod:`unittransfer.factionclone`.
  POST /api/factions/plan|/apply -> edit one faction and its shown name together
                                    (backups + undo). Editing only: a faction
                                    slot lives in twelve files at once
  GET  /api/factions/audit?mod=&campaign=
                                 -> 21, D6: every faction against every file
                                    that should name it, gap or note per row,
                                    and a template to repair each one from.
                                    See :mod:`unittransfer.factionaudit`
  POST /api/factions/repair_plan|/repair_apply
                                 -> copy the records one faction is missing out
                                    of a template, with the clone's own cloners
                                    (one backup set + undo)

Raw text (21, D11, see :mod:`unittransfer.rawtext`) - the escape hatch
  GET  /api/raw/files?mod=       -> every text file the toolkit reads, grouped,
                                    with its size, encoding and which screen
                                    edits it properly
  GET  /api/raw/file?mod=&rel=   -> one file as text, its line ending and a
                                    signature the save is checked against
  POST /api/raw/plan|/apply      -> the lines a save would change and what the
                                    toolkit's own reader makes of the result;
                                    then the write (backups + undo). Refused if
                                    the file changed on disk since it was read

EDU cleanup (export_descr_unit.txt as a whole, see :mod:`unittransfer.edusort`)
  GET  /api/edu/order?mod=       -> every section and the units in it, in the
                                    order a cleanup would leave them
  POST /api/edu/sort/plan|/apply -> tidy, tier, group and reorder the whole unit
                                    file. `marks` sets a unit's tier, variant or
                                    classification; `style` is how the section
                                    banners are drawn
                                    file (one backup + undo). `plan` never
                                    returns the new text, only what would change

Campaign Map mode (the ten TGA layers and descr_regions.txt, see
:mod:`unittransfer.campmap`). Every read route below takes `&campaign=`: a
campaign that ships its own copy of a map file is drawn, probed and checked on
it (`Registry.map_for`, 22c). The palette and the brush stay on world/maps/base,
and a stroke sent with a campaign that does not show the base map is refused.
  GET  /api/map?mod=[&campaign=] -> the manifest: tile grid, ten layers with
                                    what is wrong with each and which file each
                                    is drawn from (`rel`), the region table, and
                                    `campaign_map` - the files the campaign ships
                                    and whether the brush paints what is shown
  GET  /api/map/layer?mod=&code=&fit=[&format=rgb]
                                 -> one layer as PNG, cached on disk by mtime;
                                    with format=rgb, its raw RGB bytes and its
                                    size in X-Map-Width/-Height - what the map
                                    screen reads, because a browser may alter a
                                    picture's pixels (see campmap.layer_rgb)
  GET  /api/map/terrain?mod=&campaign=&season=[&format=png]
                                 -> 23a, D7/T1. The map drawn with the mod's own
                                    aerial-map ground textures. Without `format`,
                                    the facts: how many textures, how many tiles
                                    have none and why each one does not. With
                                    format=png, the composite itself, built once
                                    and kept on disk under a key carrying every
                                    texture the aerial file names
  GET  /api/map/legend?mod=&code=
                                 -> that layer's colours named and counted, and
                                    which of them means "nothing here"
  GET  /api/map/probe?mod=&x=&y= -> one tile as all ten layers name it
  GET  /api/map/markers?mod=&campaign=
                                 -> everything in descr_strat.txt that stands on
                                    a tile: settlements, characters, forts,
                                    watchtowers and trade resources (17d)
  GET  /api/map/region?mod=&name=
                                 -> one region: its record, its pixels, its
                                    neighbours, the pickers its boxes need, its
                                    mercenary pool (18a) and the two names the
                                    player reads for it (19a)
  POST /api/map/plan|/apply      -> edit one region of descr_regions.txt. The
                                    save also deletes map.rwm, because the game
                                    reads the compiled map in preference to the
                                    text (one backup set + undo)

The paint tool (16e, see :mod:`unittransfer.campaint`). Every route below acts
on one unsaved paint session per mod, held in memory; the strokes go into the
very layer images the routes above are served from, so the probe and the legend
show the unsaved map rather than the one on disk.
  GET  /api/map/palette?mod=     -> what each paintable layer may be painted,
                                    and the sea colours measured off this map
  POST /api/map/paint            -> one stroke: pointer samples in, the tiles
                                    that changed out
  POST /api/map/paint_undo|_redo -> one step of the unlimited stack
  POST /api/map/paint_state      -> what is unsaved, without changing anything
  POST /api/map/paint_discard    -> throw the session away and re-read the disk
  GET  /api/map/region_delete?mod=&name=&campaign=
                                 -> 24, G1. What deleting this province would
                                    have to reach: the neighbours that could
                                    inherit its land, ordered by how much border
                                    each shares, and what stands on its tiles
  POST /api/map/region_delete_plan|_apply
                                 -> the whole delete, worked out and then
                                    written: the tiles repainted to the heir,
                                    the record out of every descr_regions.txt,
                                    the settlement block, the win conditions,
                                    the pool, the music type, the lookup pair
                                    and the battle tiles. The campaign script is
                                    listed and never written
  GET  /api/campnew?mod=         -> 24, M15. The campaigns a new one could be
                                    copied from, and what copying each costs
  POST /api/campnew/plan|apply   -> make a new campaign folder from one that
                                    works, minus the compiled map, with its own
                                    header and its own new-game menu keys
  POST /api/map/region_start|_cancel
                                 -> the new-region wizard's record, decided
                                    before a pixel of it is painted
  POST /api/map/region_vocab     -> the wizard's pickers: the creator factions,
                                    the owners, the music types and which
                                    campaigns read this map (B1)
  POST /api/map/paint_plan|_apply
                                 -> write every painted layer, the new region's
                                    record, and (19a) the two names the player
                                    reads for it, in one backup set + undo

The validator (16f, see :mod:`unittransfer.mapcheck`). Run against the map the
session is holding, so it answers "would what I am about to save load?" rather
than "does what is on disk load?".
  GET  /api/map/check?mod=&campaign=
                                 -> every rule, its findings, what could not be
                                    checked and why, and the stamped baseline
  POST /api/map/baseline         -> stamp what is already wrong as inherited, or
                                    clear the stamp (`action`: take / clear)
  POST /api/map/fix_plan|fix_apply
                                 -> Geomod's three debugger actions, in one
                                    backup set + undo

Query, themes and information maps (16g, see :mod:`unittransfer.mapquery`)
  GET  /api/map/query/vocab?mod=&campaign=
                                 -> every filter with the values it can take,
                                    every theme and information map, and the
                                    reason on each one that cannot be asked
  GET  /api/map/colouring?mod=&code=&campaign=
                                 -> one theme or information map: the region to
                                    colour table the browser paints, its legend
                                    and any faction colour that had to be swapped
  POST /api/map/query            -> {rules, match} -> which provinces match, why
                                    each one does, and the colour table for them
  POST /api/map/export           -> the same as a TGA in the cache: one picture
                                    (`what`: colouring / query) or Geomod's batch
                                    (`what`: factions, one file per faction).
                                    23b: `borders`, `border_position`
                                    (edge/inside) and `border_every` are the
                                    panel's, so the file draws the frontiers the
                                    screen does

Settlements and buildings (16h, see :mod:`unittransfer.stratedit`). The first of
the three sub-phases that write descr_strat.txt itself.
  GET  /api/map/settlement?mod=&campaign=&region=
                                 -> one settlement: its fields, its buildings
                                    with what the EDB says about each, who owns
                                    it, whether it is that faction's capital,
                                    and the pickers its boxes need
  POST /api/map/settlement_plan|_apply
                                 -> edit the fields, the building list and the
                                    owner. A move is one slice of lines lifted
                                    from between two faction blocks and put back
                                    between two others (one backup + undo)

Characters, armies and the family tree (16i, see :mod:`unittransfer.stratchar`)
  GET  /api/map/faction?mod=&campaign=&faction=
                                 -> that faction's people: every character with
                                    their traits, ancillaries and army, the
                                    leader and heir, the character_records and
                                    the relative lines, and the pickers the
                                    boxes need
  POST /api/map/character_plan|_apply
                                 -> `action`: edit / add / delete / move. A new
                                    character is inserted after the faction's
                                    last one; a move is the block's own span
                                    lifted into another faction (one backup +
                                    undo)

Forts, watchtowers and resources (22a, 22b, see :mod:`unittransfer.stratobj`)
  GET  /api/map/objects?mod=&campaign=
                                 -> every fort, watchtower and trade resource
                                    in the campaign, where each is filed, the
                                    province under its tile, what is wrong with
                                    it with D10's nearest tile that would do,
                                    and the pickers the form needs
  POST /api/map/object_plan|_apply
                                 -> `kind` fort / watchtower / resource,
                                    `action` edit / add / delete / move, one
                                    line each. A new fort is filed under the
                                    province under its tile, opening that
                                    province's region section when it has none;
                                    a new resource goes where the file groups
                                    its own (one backup + undo)

The campaign's own settings (16j, see :mod:`unittransfer.stratcamp`). The third
sub-phase that writes descr_strat.txt, and the half of it that only ever
rewrites lines that are already there.
  GET  /api/map/campaign?mod=&campaign=
                                 -> the header's globals and flags, the three
                                    faction lists, the whole diplomacy matrix
                                    both ways, and every faction's own scalars
  POST /api/map/campaign_plan|_apply
                                 -> `what`: globals / rosters / standings /
                                    relationships / faction / create / delete.
                                    A save declares the runs of the file it may
                                    touch and how many lines it puts back, and
                                    the guard walks the two files rather than
                                    diffing them (one backup + undo)
  GET  /api/map/wins?mod=&campaign=
                                 -> descr_win_conditions.txt: every faction's
                                    long and short campaign, with the provinces
                                    checked against the map
  POST /api/map/wins_plan|_apply -> `action`: edit / add / delete, one faction's
                                    win conditions (one backup + undo)

Minor Files mode (the five small campaign files, see :mod:`unittransfer.minorfiles`)
  GET  /api/minor?mod=&tab=      -> one tab's whole list (rebels / religions /
                                    resources / cultures / names), with the
                                    findings counted per record
  GET  /api/minor/record?mod=&tab=&name=
                                 -> one record in full: its fields, spans, the
                                    pickers its boxes need and its text key
Guilds (18a, see :mod:`unittransfer.guilds`). ``export_descr_guilds.txt``, the
file the building side has refused against since Phase 12 and could not open.
  GET  /api/guilds?mod=          -> every guild, what it grants, how many trigger
                                    lines feed it, and the file's own findings
  GET  /api/guild?mod=&name=     -> one guild: its block, the triggers that award
                                    it points, and the pickers its boxes need
  POST /api/guilds/plan|/apply   -> add, edit or delete a guild and its triggers
                                    (one backup set + undo)

The campaign folder's small files (18a, see :mod:`unittransfer.campfiles`)
  GET  /api/campfiles/descriptions?mod=&campaign=
                                 -> the campaign's menu title and one row a
                                    faction, from campaign_descriptions.txt
  GET  /api/campfiles/movies?mod=&campaign=
                                 -> descr_faction_movies.xml as one row a
                                    faction, with the four movie slots
  GET  /api/campfiles/mercenaries?mod=&campaign=&region=
                                 -> every pool in descr_mercenaries.txt and
                                    which one that province draws on
  GET  /api/map/campaigns?mod=   -> 20b, D14: every campaign the mod ships, at
                                    any depth, with its dates, its rosters,
                                    what stands in it, which of the campaign
                                    folder's files it has and whether it ships
                                    map layers of its own
  POST /api/campfiles/plan|/apply
                                 -> one save over any of the three (`what`:
                                    descriptions / movies / mercenaries). A
                                    description write goes into the .txt and
                                    recompiles the .strings.bin beside it

Events and disasters (18b, see :mod:`unittransfer.campevents`). The two files
that say what happens without anybody doing it, and the first customers for
17d's marker layer after 17d itself.
  GET  /api/campevents/events?mod=&campaign=
                                 -> every block in descr_events.txt with its
                                    dates, positions and what is wrong with it
  GET  /api/campevents/disasters?mod=
                                 -> descr_disasters.txt (under world/maps/base,
                                    not in the campaign folder), same shape
  POST /api/campevents/plan|/apply
                                 -> add, edit or delete one block in either
                                    (`what`: events / disasters). Backups + undo

The names a new record needs (19a, see :mod:`unittransfer.namekeys`). Both of
these are "a record was written and the words the player reads for it were not",
and one of them closes a finding the validator reports against our own output.
  POST /api/namekeys/plan|/apply -> `what`: region_names writes the province and
                                    settlement lines of
                                    imperial_campaign_regions_and_settlement_names.txt;
                                    name_pool puts a character's name in the
                                    faction's descr_names.txt section AND gives
                                    it a key in text/names.txt, which are one job
                                    because either alone still shows a token.
                                    Both recompile the .strings.bin they wrote
                                    (one backup set + undo)

Renaming a thing whose name is its identity (19b, see :mod:`unittransfer.renames`).
  POST /api/renames/plan|/apply  -> `subject`: region / settlement / faction,
                                    `old`, `new`. The plan lists every file and
                                    line it would rewrite, every occurrence in a
                                    campaign script (which it refuses to edit),
                                    and every other line in the mod that writes
                                    the word and is left alone. One backup set
                                    for all of it - a rename half applied is a
                                    mod that will not load

  POST /api/minor/plan|/apply    -> add, edit or delete one record. A religion's
                                    save is four files at once - its block, the
                                    `religions` list, descr_religions_lookup.txt
                                    and text/religions.txt (backups + undo)

Strings mode (compiled data/text/*.strings.bin, see :mod:`unittransfer.strings`)
  GET  /api/strings?mod=         -> every archive: entry count, .txt state, size
  GET  /api/strings/entries?mod=&file=&q=&limit=&offset=
                                 -> that archive's rows, filtered and paged here
                                    rather than in the page (names.txt is 20 757)
  POST /api/strings/plan|/apply  -> edit entries, or `action: 'rebuild'` to
                                    recompile the archive from the .txt beside it
                                    (backups + undo, same as a transfer)

Sounds mode (the unit voice bank, see :mod:`unittransfer.sounds`)
  GET  /api/sounds?mod=          -> accents/classes, donors, and every unit split
                                    into "has a voice entry" / "doesn't"
  POST /api/sounds/plan | /apply -> stage voice edits, then write them (backups +
                                    undo, same as a transfer)

Buildings mode (export_descr_buildings.txt, see :mod:`unittransfer.buildings`)
  GET  /api/buildings?mod=&culture=
                                 -> every building line, light (the browser grid);
                                    `culture` picks which per-culture name shows
  GET  /api/buildings/variants?mod=&line=&culture=
                                 -> one building line beside its city/castle
                                    twin, tier by tier, with every unit marked
                                    as trained on both sides or on one
  GET  /api/building?mod=&line=&culture=
                                 -> one line in full: levels, stats, capabilities,
                                    recruit pools, which cultures have art and
                                    every culture's name / description
  GET  /api/buildings/checks?mod=&line=
                                 -> recruitment checks: units that stop being
