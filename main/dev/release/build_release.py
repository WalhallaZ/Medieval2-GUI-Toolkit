"""Build the shareable release zip: the tool plus a Python runtime, ready to run.

    python main/dev/release/build_release.py          # portable (bundles Python + Pillow)
    python main/dev/release/build_release.py --no-runtime   # code only; needs Python there
    python main/dev/release/build_release.py --version v1.4.0   # name the zip
    python main/dev/release/build_release.py --no-vanilla-ui    # slim, NOT for a release

The point is that the person you send it to installs nothing. The zip carries
Python's official *embeddable* distribution with Pillow already in it, so they
unzip and double-click `Launch-Medieval2-GUI-Toolkit.bat`.

Only the bare minimum ships: `app.py`, `transfer_cli.py`, `Full Cleaner.bat`,
`unittransfer/`, `web/`, the launcher, `Install-Dependencies.bat` and a README.
Never `config/` (personal settings, backups and the transfer log), `.cache/`,
`tests/`, `graphify-out/` or `__pycache__` - shipping `config/` would hand over
someone else's mod paths and undo history.

README = """Medieval 2 GUI Toolkit - edit Medieval II: Total War mods
=======================================================

Getting started
---------------
1. Unzip this whole folder somewhere (Desktop is fine). Don't run it from
   inside the zip.
2. Double-click **Launch-Medieval2-GUI-Toolkit.bat**.
3. A window appears with the startup checks, then your browser opens the tool.
   The window closes on its own once everything is up.
4. First run only: click the gear icon and point it at your Medieval II
   install folder - the one containing a `mods` folder.

{runtime_note}

Using it
--------
* Pick a **From** mod and a **To** mod at the top.
* Browse units by faction, filter by type/class/era, or search.
* Click a unit, then **Transfer to <mod>**.
* Set the options, hit **Preview** to see exactly what will change, then
  **Apply**.
* Every transfer is undoable from the clock icon - it backs up each file it
  touches first.

The other modes
---------------
The dropdown in the top-left corner switches what you are working on:

* **Unit Editor** - one mod instead of two. Click a unit to edit every EDU
  field, its name and description, the battle-model entries it uses, to build a
  new unit from it, or to delete it.
* **BMDB Editor** - the mod's whole battle_models.modeldb. Browse and edit any
  entry, even ones no unit points at, and use **Clean up BMDB** to find the
  entries nothing references, the soldier-only entries that could share an
  existing model, and the files under unit_models nothing mentions. Nothing is
  deleted: you choose a folder and everything ticked is moved there, laid out
  like the mod itself so it can be pasted straight back - and the whole removal
  is undoable from the clock icon like anything else.
* **Unit Sounds** - the mod's voice bank, which decides what a unit's soldiers
  shout when you select them. Three tabs: units with no voice entry, units with
  one, and entries whose unit no longer exists. Pick the unit to copy the
  sounds from and the row is ready; **Set all shown to copy** does a whole
  filtered list at once. It writes the voice bank AND the matching accent /
  voice_type lines in the EDU, because a unit is silent unless those two agree.
* **Buildings** - the mod's export_descr_buildings.txt, as a picture grid of
  every building line. Open one and you get a tab per level with its icons, its
  name and description, its cost, build time, material and settlement size, its
  capabilities, its upgrade path, and - the main event - its recruitment: which
  units it trains, the starting pool, the per-turn refill, the cap, the starting
  experience and the conditions on each, as rows or as a card grid. Add or
  remove units, filter the list to one faction, and hit the pencil on any unit
  to jump straight into the Unit Editor and back again with everything you had
  typed still there.

  Requirements are edited as a list of conditions rather than typed: factions
  come as a checklist of real in-game names with the code name in brackets,
  events carry their title out of historic_events.txt, and hidden resources and
  religions show which regions they actually apply to. If you let a faction
  recruit a unit it doesn't own, the editor says so and saving puts it right.

  The upgrade path is drawn as a graph - lines branch, and one of DaC's is a
  single root with everything hanging off it - and every building in it is
  clickable.

  Building icons are per culture, so there is a culture picker in the sidebar.
  Mods ship only the art they changed, so anything missing falls back to vanilla
  art if you have it (a `vanilla_ui` folder next to the app, or the
  `vanilla_ui_root` setting), then to another culture's, then to a drawn
  placeholder. The badge on each picture says which you are looking at.

What gets carried across
------------------------
The unit's EDU entry, its localised name and description, its battle models and
all their meshes/textures/sprites, its unit card and info card, its mount, its
projectile, its voice, and - for artillery - its full siege engine: the
descr_engines block, the engine skeletons and animations, the meshes, bone maps,
collision models, and the textures baked inside those meshes.

Things it warns you about rather than guessing: missing animations, files the
destination mod overrides, and effects/sounds it can't port.

Stopping it
-----------
Close the browser tab, or use the Quit button in the tool's settings.

Something went wrong?
---------------------
**The window opened and closed and nothing happened.**
That usually means the tool started fine but your browser didn't open by
itself. The tool is still running - open this address manually:

    http://127.0.0.1:8756/

If that page loads, everything is working. (Newer builds keep the window open
and tell you when this happens.)

**Still stuck?** Run **Troubleshoot.bat**. It never closes on its own, prints
what it finds, and saves `troubleshoot-output.txt` - send that file on for help.

Every run is logged in detail to `config\\server.log` (or, if this folder can't
be written, to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\UnitTransfer\\server.log`).

To re-run just the startup checks:
