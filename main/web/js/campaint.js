/* campaint.js - Campaign Map: the paint tool, its palettes and its undo

   Part of the Medieval 2 GUI Toolkit UI. These files are plain
   <script> tags sharing ONE global scope, loaded in the order set in
   index.html - there is no build step and no module system. Two rules
   follow from that: a top-level name must be unique across all of
   them, and a file's top-level side effects may not depend on a file
   loaded after it. */
/* =====================================================================
   THE BRUSH - Phase 16e.

   campmap.js draws the map and names what is under the cursor. This paints it,
   and the division of labour with the server is the whole design:

     THE BROWSER decides which tiles the pointer went over and draws a
     provisional trail so the cursor tells the truth during a drag.
     PYTHON decides which pixels change. It expands the same samples, snaps the
     colour, refuses what must not be written, and answers with the tiles that
     actually moved.
     THE BROWSER throws its trail away and writes that answer into its own copy.

   So a disagreement between what you see and what the file would say cannot
   outlive one pointer-up, there is exactly one brush that decides bytes, and
   the undo stack, the backups and every refusal live on the side that owns the
   pixels. Demir's editor paints in the browser and writes what the browser has;
   that is why its water brush can put a sea tile on a region the file still
   thinks is land.

   ONE REQUEST PER STROKE, never per pointer event. A drag accumulates samples
   and posts them once, on release. That is also the undo granularity, which is
   the granularity anybody actually wants: one press, one step back.

   REGION-COLOUR SNAPPING. Painting map_regions.tga never sends a colour. It
   sends the NAME of the selected region, and the server writes that region's
   own RGB out of descr_regions.txt. A province cannot drift a channel, the two
   marker colours cannot be produced by a brush at all, and the palette for that
   layer is the region list rather than a colour picker.

   THE WIZARD is three steps because the order is a real dependency: the record
   is decided first (the colour has to exist before the brush can snap to it),
   then the province is painted, then the settlement pixel goes on one of its own
   tiles, then the port or a skip. Every step is measured off the pixels rather
   than remembered, so the panel cannot claim a step is done when the map says
   otherwise.
