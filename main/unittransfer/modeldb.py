"""Parser/writer for battle_models.modeldb (M2TW).

The file is a length-prefixed token stream ("serialization archive"):
  * a string is stored as ``<byte-length> <that many chars>``
  * numbers are bare whitespace-delimited tokens

Header:  ``<len> serialization::archive 3 0 0 0 0 <COUNT> 0 0``
where ``<len>`` is the length of the literal "serialization::archive" and
``<COUNT>`` = number-of-real-models + 1 (the extra one is the leading ``blank`` entry).

Verified end-to-end against Third_Age_Reforged (1026 models) and
Divide_and_Conquer_EUR (2192 models): both parse to a clean EOF and round-trip
byte-exact through :meth:`ModelDb.to_text`.

For every entry we keep the *raw source substring* that produced it, so a
transfer appends a source entry verbatim and only bumps the header count -
untouched entries are never re-serialized.

        *no name follows* - and it is easy to conclude the slot can hold nothing
        else. It can. Mods fill it: BOTET writes
        ``44 unit_sprites/france_Elector_count_sprite.spr`` into one and
        Thera_Redux writes another, and with those names read as names both files
        run to a clean EOF and round-trip byte-exact. The TWCenter syntax checker
        walks attachment groups with the same routine it walks body groups, for
        the same reason.

        What is NOT a length is the stray character a hand edit leaves glued to
        the ``0`` - a ``slave`` skin deleted by hand and the ``1`` off the removed
        line left behind, giving ``... .texture 01``. Read 1 as a length and the
        next field is eaten as a one-character name, and the read dies two lines
        down on a word that is fine where it sits, which is the worst error this
        format can produce.

        The two are told apart by looking. A real sprite is a ``.spr`` path that
        fills exactly the characters its length claims and stops on whitespace; a
        stray digit's "name" is none of those things. So a name that holds up is
        read, and anything else is refused AT the stray character with the fix in
        the sentence - refused rather than assumed away, because half a dozen span
        walkers further down this file re-walk the same bytes to place an edit,
        and one of them reading a file differently from the others is how a save
        writes at the wrong offset.
