"""Adding a faction by cloning one that already works.

:mod:`unittransfer.factions` edits the roster and says, at length, why it will
not create a slot: a faction lives in nine files at once and one that exists
only in ``descr_sm_factions.txt`` is a mod that will not load. That refusal was
right about the *problem* and wrong about the *conclusion* - the answer is not
to refuse, it is to do all the files. This module does thirteen of them, and
names the three it will not touch rather than leaving them to be discovered.

**It clones rather than invents,** which is the whole reason it can be safe.
TWCenter's own step-by-step for this job (``Reference/TWCenter/Creating a world
- adding a new faction/adding_cloned_faction_steps.txt``) never writes a value
from scratch: every step is "find where the old faction is named and name the
new one too, with the same value". So there is no question of what colour, what
banner, what strat model or what unit roster the new faction gets - it gets the
donor's, everywhere, and the modder changes what they want afterwards in the
editors this toolkit already has. A clone that is a perfect copy under a new
name is a mod that loads, and a mod that loads is something you can then edit.

**What the donor's name is doing in each file is different every time**, which
is why this is a cloner per shape and not one search-and-replace:

* ``descr_sm_factions.txt`` - a whole record to copy and re-head.
* ``descr_names.txt`` - an indented ``faction: x`` section to copy.
* ``descr_lbc_db.txt`` - a ``faction x`` paragraph to copy.
* ``descr_offmap_models.txt`` - a braced ``faction x { … }`` block to copy.
* ``descr_character.txt`` and ``descr_sounds_accents.txt`` - a **shared list**:
  ``faction venice, sicily, milan`` names every faction that uses the block
  under it, so the clone joins the lists the donor is in rather than being given
  blocks of its own.
* ``export_descr_buildings.txt`` and ``descr_faction_standing.txt`` - the same
  idea inside braces, ``requires factions { sicily, }``. The EDB one is not
  optional: those clauses are what let a faction build and recruit at all, and
  one installed mod has 424 of them naming a single faction. The standing file
  spells its list **two ways** and which one a mod uses is the mod's own habit,
  so both are matched - see :func:`clone_braced_list`.
* ``descr_model_strat.txt`` - one ``texture <faction>, <path>`` line per faction
  per agent model, so each of the donor's is duplicated.
* ``export_descr_unit.txt`` - ``ownership`` lines, appended to, which is what
  gives the clone the donor's entire unit roster.
* ``battle_models.modeldb`` - texture records, which are length-prefixed and
  counted, so :func:`unittransfer.modeldb.add_texture_factions` does it: it
  already clones a donor record and fixes the group's count, and it is the same
  call the model card's faction checklist makes.
* ``text/expanded.txt`` - the shown name and the ~30 ``EMT_*`` keys, which are
  the donor's text with the donor's slot swapped out of the key.

**The art is found, not listed.** Every faction file in a real mod carries the
slot in its own name - ``symbol24_sicily_roll.tga``, ``faction_banner_sicily``,
``captain_card_sicily``, ``ui/units/sicily/`` - so the copier globs for the
donor's name as a *token* under the art roots and copies each hit to the same
path with the name swapped. A hardcoded list would have been wrong for every
mod that ships a folder vanilla does not, and mods do that constantly.

**Where the donor's name is a decision, it is reported, not cloned.** A trait
named after the faction, an ancillary's ``and FactionType sicily`` operand, a
prebattle speech - none of those is a list to join, and appending to them would
either invent a trait the engine has never heard of or silently rewrite a
boolean. :data:`REVIEW_FILES` is that list and :func:`review_mentions` counts
the hits, so the plan can say which other places name the donor instead of
letting them be discovered in a crash log.

**What it does not do, and says so.** ``descr_strat.txt`` is not cloned. A
faction's campaign entry is a region, a settlement, a starting army, a family
tree and map coordinates - the one part of this job with no correct answer to
copy, since two factions cannot start in the same settlement. The tutorial
treats it as its own step for the same reason. The clone is written, the mod
loads for custom battles, and the plan says in as many words that the campaign
needs a ``descr_strat`` entry before the faction will play. Same ruling as the
missing-picture one in :mod:`unittransfer.factions`: report the gap, do not
invent a value nobody can check.

#: Where a mod keeps art the engine finds BY CONVENTION - from the faction's own
#: name, with nothing pointing at it: ``ui/units/<faction>/``, ``symbol24_<faction>``,
#: ``faction_banner_<faction>``, ``captain_card_<faction>``. That art has to be
#: copied and renamed or the clone has none.
#:
#: Deliberately NOT here: ``models_strat/textures``, ``models_building/textures``
#: and ``loading_screen``. Those are named by a *line* - ``texture sicily,
#: models_strat/textures/spy_gondor.tga``, the roster's ``loading_logo`` - and
#: the clone's own copies of those lines already point at the donor's file, which
#: is what the tutorial has them do. Copying and renaming them would leave a
#: duplicate that nothing in the mod refers to.
ART_ROOTS: Tuple[str, ...] = ("ui", "menu", "banners")

#: Where a faction's art is *expected* to end up, one entry per place the engine
#: looks. :data:`ART_ROOTS` is what the copier scans; this is what a person goes
#: looking for afterwards, and the gap between the two is the whole of Phase 42.
#: The copier takes everything the donor has and says nothing about the places
#: the donor had nothing in, so a clone can come out of a clean, error-free run
#: with a blank button and no line anywhere saying why.
#:
#: ``kind`` is how the place names a faction: ``named`` puts the slot in the
#: file's own name (``symbol24_sicily_roll.tga``), ``folder`` makes the slot a
#: sub-folder (``ui/units/sicily/``). The copier finds both the same way and the
#: distinction is only used to word the message.
#:
#: **No two installed mods agree on which of these they fill**, which is why it
#: is a list of places to check rather than a list of files to require. Measured
#: 2026-09-14 over the four mods here, as slots covered of slots declared:

#:
#: Reforged's ``fe_symbols_80`` is an **empty folder**, so cloning any one of
#: its thirty factions leaves the 80px symbol missing however the copy goes.
#: That is the reported defect exactly, and it is the donor's gap rather than
#: the copier's fault.
#:
#: One oddity seen while measuring and deliberately left alone: Divide and
#: Conquer ships a nested ``menu/symbols/fe_buttons_24/fe_buttons_24/`` whose
#: four files are picked up as items of their own and copied to an equally
#: nested destination. That is faithful to the mod, a place still counts as
#: filled when its hits came from inside the nest, and inventing a rule to
#: flatten it would be this module guessing at the mod's own layout.

    * ``donor`` - the donor has nothing here either. Nobody can copy it and the

    * ``exists`` - the mod already ships a file of the new name here, so it was

      it was not.
    * ``rival`` - the only files here carrying the donor's name belong to a

    * ``absent`` - the mod has no such folder at all.
