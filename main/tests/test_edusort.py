"""The EDU cleanup: the tier marker, and the whole-file sorter.

Phase 14e's two halves. The **marker** is the tool's own metadata - a tier
exists in no game file, so it is written as a comment above a unit's ``type``
line under one owned prefix. The **sorter** groups the roster the way a
hand-organised ``export_descr_unit.txt`` is grouped, and the whole of its
difficulty is doing that without moving units their author already placed.

What each part is here to catch:

  * **the marker travels with its own unit.** A comment above ``type`` belongs
    to the PREVIOUS block under the old boundary rule, which would have left the
    marker behind on every transfer, replace and sort. The block now starts at
    the marker, and the parse of a file that has none is unchanged - which is
    every real file, so the round-trip sweeps still mean what they meant.
  * **setting, changing and clearing a tier is lossless**, and clearing the last
    key deletes the line rather than leaving a bare prefix.
  * **the sorter only ever moves a block.** Same units, same fields, same
    comments - asserted here from outside, not by trusting the plan's own check.
  * **it is idempotent.** Running it twice must not differ from running it once,
    which is the exit criterion and the thing most easily broken: the first
    banner of a sorted file lands in the PREAMBLE when it is read back, and
    emitting it again grows the file a banner per run.
  * **an untiered unit does not acquire a tier** by being written under a
    banner and read back - that would move it on the second run.
  * **tiers are read from the file's own banners**, because 907 of DaC's 916
    units already sit under one and nobody should type them again.

Needs no game install for the marker half. When mods ARE installed it sorts each
one in a scratch copy, which is the check that actually matters.
