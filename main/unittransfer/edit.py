"""Unit *editing* engine - the second mode of the tool (Stage 13).

Where :mod:`unittransfer.transfer` moves a unit from one mod into another, this
module changes a unit **inside a single mod**:

  * edit any EDU field of an existing unit (including deleting a field outright -
    blanking a value is not the same thing to the game);
  * rename its ``type`` / ``dictionary`` (the dictionary rename carries the
    localisation record and the unit-card files with it, otherwise the unit
    silently loses its name and icons);
  * edit its localised name / description / short description;
  * edit the battle_models.modeldb entries it uses - every mesh / texture /
    normal-map / sprite path, and the entry name (EDU refs follow the rename);
  * create a NEW modeldb entry cloned from one the unit already uses: you point
    at a mesh and a texture on disk and say which folder inside ``data/`` they
    should land in, and the files are copied there and the entry rewritten to
    reference them. Sprites, the faction (ownership) texture records and the
    footer - animations/skeletons and the torch block - come from the cloned
    entry, so the new model stays valid;
  * delete a unit, optionally taking its localisation record, its now-unused
    modeldb entries and its icons with it.

Creating a *new unit from an existing one* is not implemented here: that is
exactly a transfer whose source and destination are the same mod, so the UI
reuses :func:`unittransfer.transfer.plan_transfer` for it and gets dedup,
conflict resolution, the base-unit templating and the field editor for free.

Every write goes through the same backup + log record as a transfer, so the
existing Undo / "Revert to here" buttons work on edits too.
