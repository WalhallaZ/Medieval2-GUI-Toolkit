"""What one mod actually has on disk, per module - the Home page's readiness matrix.

The reference tool opens with an upload box: you pick a ``data`` folder and it
tells you which files it found. We already know where every mod is, so the same
question is answered the other way round - for each mod the toolkit can see, say
which of the files each module needs are there, how big they are, and whether
they can be read at all.

The point is to answer "why is this greyed out" before it is asked. A mod with no
``export_descr_sounds_units_voice.txt`` is not broken and Unit Sounds is not
broken; there is simply nothing there, and saying so on the landing page is
cheaper than letting someone find out three clicks in.

Everything here is read-only and deliberately shallow: file paths come from
:class:`unittransfer.mod.Mod` (the one place that knows them) and a file is
opened only far enough to sniff its encoding, never parsed. A mod card must not
cost what opening the mod costs.
