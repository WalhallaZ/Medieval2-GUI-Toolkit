"""Whole-file cleanup of ``data/export_descr_unit.txt``.

The EDU is one block per unit and nothing tells the engine what order they come
in, so a file worked on for years ends up with units wherever there was room.
Divide and Conquer's is the counter-example, and its shape is deliberate:
generals first, then one contiguous run per faction sub-sectioned by banner
comments reading ``;--- GONDOR TIER 1 INFANTRY ---``, then the sections that
belong to no faction - rebels, mercenaries, siege, ships.

This module puts any mod's EDU into that shape. Three rules run through it:

* **It splices, it never re-emits.** A unit's block is moved as the verbatim
  lines it already was. The only bytes this module authors are the section
  banners; everything else is carried, so a comment nobody has a rule for
  survives whatever happens around it.
* **It prefers the order already in the file.** The grouping is a *stable* sort
  on ``(section, tier, category)``, so units that already agree about where they
  belong keep the order they are in, and a file already in shape comes back
  byte for byte. That is also what makes a second run a no-op.
* **A tier is read before it is asked for.** The tier a unit sorts by is the
  tool's own metadata (:data:`unittransfer.edu.MARKER`) and no game file has it
  - but a mod that has organised its EDU by hand has already *written* it, in
  the banners. 907 of DaC's 916 units sit under one. So :func:`harvest_tiers`
  reads the file's own banners rather than asking anyone to type 916 numbers,
  which is the same rule the rest of the toolkit follows for vocabularies: what
  the mod's file declares is read from the file that declares it.

The preamble - everything above the first unit, which in DaC is a hand-written
table of contents - is never touched. It names factions in words this module
cannot re-derive, and rewriting it would mean guessing.
