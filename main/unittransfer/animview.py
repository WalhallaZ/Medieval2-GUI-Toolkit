r"""Every animation a model has, for the Models viewer, straight from the packs (Phase 80).

Phase 55's viewer played what ``descr_skeleton.txt`` names and the mod ships
loose, which for DaC was 1 753 of 15 661 and for most mods nothing. The game
plays the packs, so the viewer does too now:

* **the skeletons** come from the model's modeldb entry, one set per mount
  type (``none``, ``horse``, ``camel``...), each a primary and a secondary
  skeleton and the weapon skeletons of each;
* **the actions** are the filled slots of each skeleton **in
  ``skeletons.dat``**, named by Phase 78's table and grouped by family, with
  the frame count, duration, distance and speed of each out of its
  ``pack.dat`` entry, and the slot's impact frame, turn limits and sound
  events;
* **the keys** are read straight out of ``pack.dat`` and given the packed
  skeleton's bones (:func:`read`). A loose file at the same path is still
  preferred, as the game may prefer it too (Phase 82's question 6).

A mod with no pack of its own plays vanilla's, as the game does, and the view
says so. A skeleton the packs have not got falls back to Phase 55's chain,
``descr_skeleton.txt`` and loose files only.

80b adds the unit as the game assembles it:

* **the weapon skeletons** (:func:`add_weapons`). A weapon skeleton is two or
  three bones rooted at a hand (``bone_Rhand``, ``bone_weapon01``), its root's
  pivot where that hand is in the T-pose. Its action for the body's slot, or
  its ``default`` when that slot is empty, is resampled onto the body's keys
  and its bones hung under the body's hand, so a mesh weighted to
  ``bone_weapon01`` (1 066 of ROCSS's 1 800 soldier meshes) moves its weapon
  with the arm instead of with the pelvis;
* **the mount** (:func:`mounts_for`): the mounts a rider's units ride, out of
  the EDU and ``descr_mount.txt``, each with its model and ``rider_offset``,
  where the rider sits relative to the mount's root bone;
* **a ``.cas`` model** (:func:`cas_view`), played by the skeleton its
  ``descr_model_strat.txt`` entry names;
* **the same action in another mod** (:func:`compare`), for the side-by-side
  view a port is checked with.
