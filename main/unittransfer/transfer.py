"""Cross-mod unit transfer (Stage 4): interactive, in-place, undoable.

Pipeline:
  plan_transfer(source, unit_type, dest, options) -> TransferPlan
      resolves the dependency set, decides bmdb dedup/rename per model, detects the
      unit-name conflict, and collects warnings (excluded secondaries, missing
      skeletons, missing files).
  apply_transfer(plan) -> record dict
      writes changes DIRECTLY into the destination mod, backing up every touched
      file first, and appends a log record containing the undo manifest.
  undo(transfer_id) -> restores backups / deletes created files.

Options let the user include or exclude officer / crew / mount models; excluded
secondaries keep their original EDU name and raise a warning (they must already
exist in the destination). bmdb rule: same name + identical content -> reuse;
same name + different content -> the incoming entry is renamed and every EDU
model reference is updated to match.
