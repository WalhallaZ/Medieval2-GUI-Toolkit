"""The validator: everything that stops a campaign map loading. Phase 16f.

16a to 16e read the map, drew it, made one region editable and let a brush
change the pixels. This is the part that says whether what came out of all that
will start. It is the union of four reference tools' rule sets - Demir's
editor, Mylae's eight checks, TWMapReader's twenty-three and Geomod's debugger
- with the duplicates folded together and every rule carrying the source that
says it is a rule at all.

**A rule with no evidence reports nothing.** This is the load-bearing decision
of the phase and it is the one a validator gets wrong. The game's own ``data/``
is packed: ``descr_climates.txt`` is not on disk, ``descr_sm_resources.txt`` is
not on disk, and the region and settlement name file is not on disk. A checker
that reads "no climate is declared" as "every climate colour is undeclared"
reports 11 faults, 55,755 tiles and 112 missing name keys against a map that
ships with the game and works. So every rule that needs a vocabulary asks for
it first, and a missing one puts a line in :attr:`Report.skipped` saying which
file would have to exist - never a finding. Absence of the evidence is not the
finding.

**A finding is identified by what it is about, not by where it is written.**
:attr:`Finding.key` is a hash of the rule, the file and the thing - a region's
name, a tile's coordinates, a resource's name and position - so it survives
every edit that shifts a line number. That is what makes the baseline work:
:func:`take_baseline` stamps the keys a mod already had when it was untouched,
and from then on those findings are still shown and still counted but they no
longer block a save. A mod is somebody else's work with somebody else's bugs in
it, and a tool that refuses to save until the user has fixed 40 faults they did
not create is a tool nobody uses twice.

**Every fatal here is a crash somebody has had.** The three severities are
``fatal`` (the map will not load, or loads and crashes), ``warn`` (wrong, and
the game runs) and ``note`` (worth knowing, not wrong). Only ``fatal`` blocks,
and only when it is not in the baseline.

Four auto-fix actions, including Geomod's debugger's three::

    heights_black       ambiguous (0,0,0) altitudes on land -> (1,1,1)
    resource_duplicate  the second of two identical resource lines, deleted
    resource_position   a resource that is off the grid or in the sea, deleted
    resource_move       a resource in the sea -> its calculated nearest land

Vanilla is the measurement for the first one, and it is a better example than
the one this phase was scoped with. ``map_heights.tga`` has 55 tiles painted
pure black on land that ``map_ground_types.tga`` calls land, and
:func:`mapvocab.is_sea_height` has to read black as sea because that is what the
engine does. Two of those 55 have a port standing on them - Nottingham's, and
**Ragusa's**, which is the port bug Geomod's manual names its debugger action
after. The fix is the one Geomod makes: black is ambiguous, ``(1,1,1)`` is not,
and the picture is identical.

Everything a fix writes goes through one backup set and one log entry, so the
Log's Undo puts it back byte-exact - the same route :func:`campaint.apply_paint`
takes, for the same reason.
