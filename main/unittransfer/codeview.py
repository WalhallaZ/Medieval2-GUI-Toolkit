"""Code View - the server half of "the GUI and the raw file, side by side".

Every editor in the toolkit shows a mod file as labelled boxes. Code View adds
the other view of the same bytes: the text as the game reads it, with a map
saying which line each box came from. Hover a stat, its line lights up; type in
the text, the boxes follow.

The rule this module exists to enforce is that **the browser never parses a game
file**. The page owns pixels; ``unittransfer`` owns formats. So the widget asks
here for three things and nothing else:

  * :func:`document` - text + fields + spans for something already on disk
  * :func:`parse` - the user typed in the text pane: re-read it, or say why not
  * :func:`render` - the user typed in a box: re-serialise, through the very
    serialiser the save path uses, so the text pane can never promise a byte the
    save would not write
  * :func:`repair` - optional, for a format whose text carries bookkeeping a
    person cannot be expected to maintain by hand (the modeldb's length
    prefixes). Never automatic: the page offers it as a button.

A *kind* is one file shape (``edu``, ``edb``, ``bmdb``, ``strings``, ``traits``,
``ancillaries`` today; the minor files join later). Each kind supplies a parse
function and a render function and gets the whole widget for free - that is the
point of building it once.

``render``'s ``edits`` argument is kind-shaped, and deliberately so: it is
whatever that editor's save request already sends (``{overrides, removals}`` for
a unit's EDU block, the level-edit body for a building line, the path map for a
modeldb entry). The pane and the save then take the same road, which is the only
way the pane can promise what the save will write.

Spans are ``{label: [[first_line, last_line], ...]}``, 1-based and inclusive,
counted from the first line of the text being shown. A label may own more than
one span, and a repeated key is numbered ``key#2`` exactly as the field lists
already number it.

# them is half the reason the guided view exists, so the pane hides them.
#
# What it must not do is lose them. `buildings.py`'s rule holds for every splice
# parser here: 7203 real input lines carry a comment and the write path has to
# put every one back byte for byte. So the hiding is a PAIR of functions, not a
# filter: the page is handed the text without the comment lines plus an opaque
# `hidden` list, sends both back, and the server rebuilds the real text before
# anything parses or saves. The page never learns what a comment looks like in
# this format, which is the rule the rest of the module already follows.

#: What opens a comment in each kind's file. A kind that is absent cannot hide
#: anything - the modeldb stores lengths rather than text a person comments, and
#: the strings archives have a convention this has not measured. `#` is on the
#: EDB because Phase 13 ruled it a modder's annotation there, and every parser in
#: buildings.py already skips it.
