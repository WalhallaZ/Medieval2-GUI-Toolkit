/* core.js - shared state, the API client, the module registry and the burger
   menu, mod loading, filters, and the card grid every mode paints into

   Part of the Medieval 2 GUI Toolkit UI. These files are plain
   <script> tags sharing ONE global scope, loaded in the order set in
   index.html - there is no build step and no module system. Two rules
   follow from that: a top-level name must be unique across all of
   them, and a file's top-level side effects may not depend on a file
   loaded after it. */

/* ---------- the files this page is made of ----------
   One dropped <script> used to look like a dead server.

   index.html asks for two dozen files at once, and the page loads whether or
   not they all arrive: a missing one leaves its module's functions simply
   absent, so the first call into it throws a ReferenceError far from the cause
   - and the startup screen said the server could not be reached, while that
   server's own log showed every request of that same second answered. It is
   the one place the reader would never look.

   iconRetry below already refetches a dropped unit card for exactly this
   reason. A dropped module is the same accident with a worse ending, so it
   gets the same answer: fetch it again, in the order index.html lists them
   (a file may not depend on one loaded after it), and only give up out loud,
   naming the file, once it really will not come. */

/* ---------- panes the user can resize ----------

   Every list in this tool sits in a box whose height someone chose once: 340px
   for a building's recruitment pools, 230px for a unit's upgrade list, 92vh for
   the dialog holding either. Those are fine defaults and wrong for half the
   work. A barracks that trains sixty units gets the same 340px as one that
   trains two, on a monitor the tool never asked about, and the only ways out
   were scrolling a list inside a scrolling dialog or not looking.

   So every scroll box on the page grows a grab corner, and so do the dialog and
   the unit drawer. Three decisions keep that one small piece of code instead of
   fifty scattered ones:

     * **the boxes find themselves.** A scroll box in this stylesheet is a rule
       that sets `max-height` and `overflow:auto` together, and there is no
       second kind of one. `rszSelectors` reads the page's own CSS once at
       startup and collects those selectors, so a list written next month is
       resizable the day it is written, with nothing to remember here.
     * **the browser does the dragging.** `resize` is a real CSS property with a
       real grip and real hit-testing. Two things stop it working out of the
       box: a `max-height` caps the drag, and these screens rebuild their markup
       wholesale so the result is thrown away on the next keystroke. Undoing
       those two is the whole job.
     * **nothing is touched until it is dragged.** A box keeps the height the
       stylesheet gave it, shrink-to-fit and all, until the pointer goes down on
       its corner. Only then does it get a pinned height, so a screen nobody has
       resized still lays out exactly as it always did.

   Sizes are remembered per box, in `pane_sizes` on `/api/settings`, because how
   tall the recruitment list should be is a fact about the user's screen and
   habits rather than about the dialog that happens to be open. Double-click a
   grip to hand the box back to the stylesheet. */

/* ---------- the browser's Back button ----------

   The whole toolkit is one page. A module, a dialog over it, sometimes a second
   panel stacked on the first - none of that is a browser page, so Back used to
   leave the tool outright, usually to the blank tab the launcher opened it in.
   It now steps back through the screens the tool actually has, and so do the
   mouse's own back button and Alt+←, which the browser sends down the same wire.

   There is no recorded history of screens to replay, and there deliberately
   isn't: every layer already knows how to close itself, and its on-screen
   Back / Cancel / ✕ is the call that does it. A press therefore asks the layers,
   innermost first, "are you what is on top?" - and the first one that says yes
   goes back exactly as its own button would, including whatever that button
   stops to ask first. A press and a click can never become two different ways
   out of one screen.

   One spare history entry is what makes a press reach us at all: it sits ahead
   of the page, each press spends it, and a press we answered puts it back. A
   press nothing answers is Home with nothing open - the tool's own root - and
   there the spare is left spent, so a second press leaves the page the way it
   always did. The next thing the user clicks arms it again. */
