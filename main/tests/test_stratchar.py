"""``descr_strat.txt``, write: people - Phase 16i's exit criteria, measured.

16h proved a settlement block could be rewritten without disturbing a byte it
did not mean to. This is the same gate on the other half of a faction block, and
it is a bigger one: **479 character blocks across vanilla's two campaigns and
Third Age Reforged are re-rendered with no edits and must come back byte for
byte**, tabs, trailing spaces and the comment somebody left on a regiment
included.

The exit criteria, in the order they are checked:

    a general with an army is added to a faction on both test mods
    every character rule passes on the result
    the file outside the edited block is byte-identical
    a move takes the block that left and puts it back unchanged
    the save backs up, and the log's undo puts the file back byte-exact

Five parts, the last two of which need a real game install:

    1  the lines: shapes taken off the file, and edits that rewrite one of them
    2  the four actions: edit, add, delete and move
    3  the rules: what is fatal, what is a warning, and what is not checked
    4  every real campaign: 479 blocks re-rendered, and real plans over a sample
    5  the two routes, a real save and its undo, on a throwaway mod
