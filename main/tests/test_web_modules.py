"""The UI's split JavaScript: one global scope, so nothing may collide.

`web/index.html` loads `web/js/*.js` as plain <script> tags - no build step, no
module system. Everything therefore shares ONE global scope, which makes two
mistakes silent and expensive:

  * **a duplicate top-level name.** Whichever declaration loads last wins, and
    function declarations hoist, so the loser's callers quietly call the winner.
    This already happened once: the composer's `setMode` swallowed the burger
    menu's until it was renamed `setAppMode`.
  * **a file that stops being loaded.** Deleting a <script> tag, or adding a
    module file and forgetting the tag, leaves the page half-wired at runtime
    rather than failing at build time - there is no build.

So this test reads the script tags out of index.html and holds them against the
files on disk, then scans every top-level declaration for collisions. It needs
no game install and no browser. Node, if present, also syntax-checks each file.
