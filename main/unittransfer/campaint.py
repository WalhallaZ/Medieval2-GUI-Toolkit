"""The paint tool: strokes, unlimited undo, and the write. Phase 16e.

:mod:`unittransfer.campmap` reads the map and owns the region record. This is
the other half - the one that changes pixels - and the split is deliberate:
everything here mutates, and a module that mutates should not also be the one
everything else reads through.

**Python owns the bytes.** The browser draws a provisional trail under the
cursor and posts the pointer samples; this module expands them, snaps the
colour, refuses what must not be written, applies it to the layer image the
whole server is already reading, and answers with the tiles that actually
changed. The browser replaces its trail with that answer. So there is one brush
that decides pixels, one undo stack, one backup and one file writer, and a
disagreement between the preview and the file cannot outlive a pointer-up.

Five tools, from the two reference editors that have any::

    pencil   one tile
    brush    a disc or square of tiles, interpolated along the drag
    bucket   four-connected flood fill of one colour on one layer
    pipette  reads - it never writes, and is answered by /api/map/probe
    water    Demir's water brush: regions, heights and ground types together

**Region-colour snapping** is the rule that makes the first four safe. Painting
``map_regions.tga`` never writes a colour picked off the screen: it writes the
selected region's canonical RGB out of ``descr_regions.txt``, or the sea colour
measured off this mod's own map. Drift is therefore impossible - a province
painted one channel off is a province the engine cannot see, and DaC ships
exactly that mistake in a 517-tile hole at (318,54) - and the two marker colours
can never be produced by accident, because they are not in the palette at all.
They are placed by the wizard, one tile at a time, and a stroke that would cover
one skips it and says how many it protected.

**One colour per layer per stroke.** Every tool here writes a single value, so a
stroke is a tile list plus one RGB rather than a bitmap. That is what makes the
undo stack cheap enough to be unlimited: Geomod has one level, Mylae keeps one
snapshot of the whole layer and Demir has no undo at all, and all three are
paying for a model where a stroke could have been anything.

**The tile is the unit, and the block is what a tile owns.** Three of the ten
layers are one pixel per tile; the others are 2W x 2H or 2W+1 x 2H+1, and a
tile there is a block of pixels rather than one. :func:`block` is that rule,
and it partitions the layer exactly - every pixel of an aligned layer belongs
to exactly one tile, the ``2W+1`` layers' leading row and column included, so
painting cannot leave a stale seam between two tiles that were both painted.
The block always contains the pixel the engine samples, which is the invariant
the tests hold it to: paint a tile, and :meth:`CampaignMap.centres` at that
tile is the colour that was painted.

Nothing here writes to disk until :func:`apply_paint`. Until then the strokes
live in the layer images the server is already serving from, so the probe, the
legend and the layer PNGs all show the unsaved state - there is no second copy
of the pixels to disagree with the first. What that costs is stated in
:class:`PaintSession`: a map re-read from disk underneath an unsaved session
drops it, and says so rather than saving over what changed.
