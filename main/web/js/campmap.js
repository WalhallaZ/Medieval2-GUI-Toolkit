/* campmap.js - Campaign Map: the renderer

   Part of the Medieval 2 GUI Toolkit UI. These files are plain
   <script> tags sharing ONE global scope, loaded in the order set in
   index.html - there is no build step and no module system. Two rules
   follow from that: a top-level name must be unique across all of
   them, and a file's top-level side effects may not depend on a file
   loaded after it. */
/* =====================================================================
   THE CAMPAIGN MAP - ten TGA layers, one canvas.

   Phase 16c built the renderer: it draws, it pans, it zooms and it tells you
   which tile is under the cursor. Phase 16d added the three things that make
   it readable and the one that makes it an editor - the layer stack remembered
   between sessions, a legend in which a layer's "nothing here" colour stops
   being drawn, a probe naming one tile on all ten layers at once, and the
   region record itself with its Code View. Phase 16e made it an editor of the
   pixels as well: campaint.js arms a brush over this canvas, writes through
   `cmapPixels` and repaints through `cmapAfterPaint`, and everything in this
   file that reads a layer reads the painted copy rather than the picture that
   arrived. It still does not validate; 16f is the validator.

   THE BROWSER NEVER PARSES A TGA. Python decodes every layer, projects it to
   one pixel per tile and serves PNG from /api/map/layer; the manifest at
   /api/map says what the layers are and what every region colour means. That
   is the "one engine" rule: there is one region index, one set of colour
   tables and one file writer, and they are all on the Python side. It is also
   what makes 16e's undo and backups possible at all.

   Four rules keep this fast, and all four are answers to something a reference
   tool does. Demir's editor nulls the layer canvas on every painted pixel, so
   the next render re-uploads the whole image - forty full-image uploads inside
   one 40px drag - and rebuilds its terrain composite over ~820k pixels with
   seven string-keyed Map lookups each. None of that is a language problem:

     1. ONE COMPOSITE, BUILT WHEN THE LAYER SET CHANGES. Not per frame, not
        per pointer event. Pan and zoom never touch it - they only decide which
        part of it to copy.
     2. ONLY THE VISIBLE SUB-RECT IS COPIED. At zoom 20 the screen holds a few
        hundred tiles; blitting all 248,370 of DaC's would be work thrown away.
     3. DIRTY RECTANGLES. Moving the cursor one tile repaints two small
        rectangles - the cell it left and the cell it entered - not the canvas.
     4. NOTHING O(PIXELS) ON THE INTERACTION PATH. Picking is a lookup in a
        colour table the manifest brought. The one per-pixel pass in this file
        builds a selected region's outline, and it runs on the click that
        selects, once, and is cached.

   THE PICKED PIXEL IS THE PIXEL UNDER THE CURSOR, at every zoom. The whole
   transform is two lines - a tile's left edge is `ox + tx*zoom`, and the tile
   under a point is `floor((x - ox)/zoom)` - which are exact inverses of each
   other at any zoom and any device pixel ratio. Everything drawn on the map,
   markers included, goes through the same two lines rather than a second copy
   of the arithmetic, because a second copy is how a marker ends up a pixel off
   the thing it marks.

   Three coordinate systems, same as the Python side, and every name here says
   which one it means:
     image   (0,0) top-left, y down. The canvas, and the layer PNGs.
     game    (0,0) bottom-left, y up. What descr_strat.txt writes.
     screen  CSS pixels in the canvas. Multiplied by DPR only at the very edge.
   ===================================================================== */

/* Zoom is in screen pixels per tile. The floor is below one because DaC's map
   is 510x487 and a small window should still be able to show all of it; the
   ceiling is where one tile fills a quarter of a 1080p screen, which is as far
   in as anyone can want to place a settlement pixel. */

   terrain says what it could not draw.

/* ---------- 28a: the side column is a tab strip, not a stack ----------
   ---------- 49: and the strip is two of them ----------

   `#cmSide` was sixteen panels appended one under the last - the mod header,
   the read's own findings, and then Campaigns, Find, Views, Check, Query,
   Paint, Markers, Events, Layers, the picked tile, Delete, Settlement, Forts,
   Characters, Campaign settings and Strat models. On a 1600px window the strat
   models sat four screens below the fold, which is a column you scroll rather
   than a menu you use.

   **A tab is a GROUP of panels, not one panel.** Sixteen tabs would be the same
   column laid on its side. These six are the six errands the screen is for:
   choosing what is read, checking it, asking it questions, painting it, looking
   at one province, and the campaign that runs on it.

   **49: and a group's panels are a strip of their own rather than a stack.**
   28a grouped them and then put every panel of a group one under the next,
   which is the column again as soon as a group has seven of them - Province
   did. Each group now carries a list of SUB-TABS and one of them is showing,
   so `CMAP_TABS` is two levels deep and `cmapTabPanels` is what flattens it.

   **Validate is a tab of its own, and the user asked for it by name.** Mylae's
   map screen is `Strat` / `Validate` / `3D` across the top with the whole of his
   validation behind the middle one, and that placement is better than a section
   in a stack of sixteen. What goes behind ours is the larger half anyway: 32
   rules with a severity, a baseline and auto-fixes, against his eight checks.

   **The layers are not in here**, and that is 20a's ruling standing: the stack
   is the ten files the map is made of and it is what the number keys tick, so
   it is not behind a tab. 50 moved it off this column altogether - it is a
   button at the foot of the map and a panel over it, `cmapLayPop` - which is
   the same ruling and the rest of it: ticking a layer while reading a finding
   is the ordinary errand on this screen, and now it does not cost the tab body
   45% of its height or vanish when the column is collapsed.

   The ids are the ones every panel module already writes into
   (`document.getElementById('cmPick')` and its fifteen siblings), so grouping
   them cost those files nothing: each group is a `<div>` that is hidden or not,
   each sub-tab is a `<div>` inside it that is hidden or not, and every panel
   stays in the DOM and keeps its own state. Strat models is not in the list any
   more - 49 moved it to the Models Editor, where a mod's models are. */

   One copy of six lines that were written three times: the query panel's jump

   callers is where a third copy stops being a coincidence - and the rule this
   file states about the two transform lines applies to arriving as well as to
   drawing. `zoom` is a floor rather than a setting: somebody already zoomed
   further in than that was looking at something.

   `region` is the province the caller already knows this tile is in, and it
   closes a half-arrival all three of them had. `cmapPick` resolves a province
   by reading the colour under the tile off the region layer's own pixels, so
   with that layer never fetched - it is one tick away from off, and off is a
   perfectly ordinary way to read a map - a jump would centre on the tile and
   select nothing, with only the probe's sentence to say where you were. Every
   caller that HAS the name passes it: a query row is a province and a find hit
   is one. A finding is not - `mapcheck` reports a tile and a sentence about
   what is wrong there, and half of those are faults with no province at all -
   so the validator's jump passes nothing and is unchanged. The pick is given a
   second chance from the manifest rather than a layer being turned on behind
   somebody's back, which is the call 20a made about controls that rearrange
   the stack. */

     `overlay`      the fill - each province in its group's colour, or nothing
                    where it is in no group.
     `overlayEdge`  the frontiers, which are a line and are drawn as one.

   `solid` lays the fill over the map at the panel's opacity, which is what 16g
   always did. `tint` draws it with the canvas `color` blend, which takes the
   HUE AND SATURATION of the fill and the LUMINOSITY of what is already on the
   canvas - so the terrain's relief, its forests and its snow all still read and
   only the colour is the theme's. That is exactly TWMapReader's HSB fill: he
   runs the region's own pixels through a grayscale filter and then an
   HSBAdjustFilter set to the tint's hue and saturation, which is the same
   operation in two steps. His brightness stretch and its two cutoffs have
   nothing to port - they exist because his filter REPLACES the brightness and
   has to be stopped from crushing the relief, and the blend keeps it untouched.

   The frontiers are always laid on rather than blended. A border colour is a
   near-black with almost no saturation, and a `color` blend of that is a grey
   wash, not a line - it would delete the borders exactly when the tint made
   them most necessary. They take the same opacity as the fill, as they did when
   they were pixels inside it. */

   Mylae's `MapPixelTooltip` is the thing his map reads best: hover a tile and a
   small panel beside the cursor names it on every layer at once. 16d had the
   same answer already - `campmap.probe_pixel` names one tile across all ten
   layers in 0.17 ms on vanilla and 0.80 ms on DaC - but put it behind a CLICK,
   because a round trip on the pointer is what this screen's rules exist to
   prevent. So this is the probe's answer, worked out in the browser: the layer
   pixels are the ones it was already served and the three tables it cannot
   derive travel with the manifest (`_vocab_view`).

   Two things his version gets wrong and this one does not. He nearest-colour
   matches a layer's legend within a distance of 30, which names colours that
   are not in the file at all, and tolerance-matches regions within 6, which on
   a map carrying a one-channel painting slip - and both real maps carry
   several - confidently names the wrong province. Every match here is exact,
   and a colour no table claims is said to be one. */

/* Grey level -> alpha for the heights layer, over the heights THIS map has.

   20a, T2. TWMapReader's rule is "darker means more transparent", and taken
   literally - alpha = the grey itself - it does not work on a real map. Land on
   both installed mods runs 1 to 255 but is nowhere near evenly spread: the
   median land tile is 32 of 255 on Divide and Conquer and 31 on Third Age
   Reforged, and a quarter of the land is under 19. A linear ramp draws half the
   continent at under 13% alpha, which is a layer you have ticked and cannot
   see.

   So the ramp is the land's own distribution: a tile's alpha is how much of the
   land is no higher than it. Darker is still more transparent - the mapping is
   monotonic, so no two heights swap places - but the ramp is spread over the
   heights the map actually contains rather than over a 0-255 nothing uses the
   top of. The panel says this in a sentence, because a ramp that is not the
   obvious one has to be readable off the screen.

   Sea is not on the ramp at all. `mapvocab.is_sea_height`'s measured rule - sea
   iff the pixel is not greyscale, or is black - is the same one `cmapNameColour`
   mirrors, and sea has no height to be a depth of.

   Comes back with the map's own median land height beside the ramp, because the
   panel has to be able to say what the ramp is spread over and the histogram is
   already in hand. The two installed mods happen to agree at 32 and 31; that is
   not a reason to print either of them over somebody else's map.

   One pass to count and one to write, both inside the mask pass's own budget.

   in the request and switching campaign does not change the answer.

   Two states this panel reports rather than tidies away, because both are real
   on the mods installed here: a province under two music types (58 of
   `vanilla_kingdoms_uncompromised`'s) and one named twice inside a single type

   Ten layers and ten number keys leaves no digit for the two zoom commands 16c

   say so. Shift rather than a letter because the digit is the mnemonic - fit is
   still zero - and because Ctrl+1 and Ctrl+0 are the browser's own and a page
   cannot have them.

   The point of the whole item is what it does NOT disturb: a layer is ticked
   without the pointer moving, so the tile under it and the tooltip naming that
   tile on all ten layers stay exactly where they were. `cmapMode`'s repanel
   rebuilds the side panel and nothing else; the canvas, the hover and the

/* ---- 33, T10: the tile on the clipboard, in the form the file wants ----

   The detail is already under the pointer and has been since 17e; what was
   missing was any way to get it out of the screen and into a text editor. This
   puts it on the clipboard as `x 109, y 147`, which is measured off vanilla's
   own `descr_strat.txt` rather than chosen: every one of its `character` lines
   ends `..., x 109, y 147`, and that is the form the engine reads.

   **Game coordinates, not image ones.** The two differ by `y` counting from the
   bottom, and the whole file counts from the bottom - a copy that handed over
   the image `y` would be a copy that puts a general on the wrong side of the
   map. The readout and the tooltip have shown both since 16c; this copies the
   one that can be pasted.

   **The tile under the cursor, or the middle of the view.** "Copy the view, or
   what is under the cursor" is one key: with the pointer on the map it is the
   tile under it, and with the pointer anywhere else it is the tile at the
   centre of what is on screen, which is the view. A picked tile wins over
   neither - it is the pointer that is being pointed with.

   The write-up says "the shift-X detail is the model" and there is no shift-X
   anywhere in this tool or in its history. Taken as `c` for copy, beside `t`
   for the tooltip and `f` for find, which is the pattern this screen's letters
   already follow. */
