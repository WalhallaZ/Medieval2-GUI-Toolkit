/* regiondel.js - Campaign Map: deleting a province, and who gets its land

   Part of the Medieval 2 GUI Toolkit UI. These files are plain
   <script> tags sharing ONE global scope, loaded in the order set in
   index.html - there is no build step and no module system. Two rules
   follow from that: a top-level name must be unique across all of
   them, and a file's top-level side effects may not depend on a file
   loaded after it. */
/* =====================================================================
   DELETE A PROVINCE - Phase 24, G1.

   Every name here starts `rdl`. The rules are all Python's - which neighbours
   could inherit the land, what is written where, what is refused - and this
   file asks the two questions that have an answer only somebody looking at the
   map can give: who inherits, and what happens to the port.

   THE PANEL IS TWO STEPS AND THE SECOND ONE IS THE EXPENSIVE ONE. Opening it
   is a read of the map object that is already in memory, so it appears; working
   the delete out walks the whole mod looking for every line that names the
   province, which is seconds on a cold disk. So the heirs, the tiles and what
   stands on the land come back on the click that opens this, and the list of
   files comes back on a button that says it is going to think.

   NOTHING IS DELETED WITHOUT THE LIST IN FRONT OF SOMEBODY. The confirm is the
   plan's own changes and warnings, not a sentence about them, because a delete
   reaches up to a dozen files in two campaigns and no shorter summary of that
   is honest. The campaign script is the one thing this will not edit, and the
   lines it found are shown before the confirm rather than after it.
