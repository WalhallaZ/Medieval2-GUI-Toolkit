"""The paint tool - Phase 16e's exit criteria, measured.

16c drew the map, 16d made the record editable; this changes the pixels. Six
claims are under test, and every one of them is the sort a paint tool gets
quietly wrong:

    campaint.block        a tile owns a rectangle, and the rectangles partition
                          the layer exactly - no seam, no pixel owned twice
    campaint.expand       the brush shape, and the line that joins two samples
    campaint.flood        four-connected, and it stops at a marker
    campaint.paint        region-colour snapping, the marker protection, and
                          the refusals - an unknown colour is never written
    campaint.undo_stroke  a stroke undone is the layer's own bytes back, not a
                          repaint of the old colour over the new one
    campaint.apply_paint  every painted layer, the new region's record and
                          map.rwm, in one backup set the Log's Undo reverses

The load-bearing claim of the whole phase is checked rather than argued:
**a layer written back is byte-identical outside the painted rectangle**, and
**undo restores it byte-exact**. Both are asserted on a map written here and
again on every real map installed.

Six parts, the last three of which need a game install:

    1  the tile -> pixel rule, and the partition
    2  the brush and the bucket, on grids whose answer is workable by hand
    3  a whole small map on disk: strokes, snapping, refusals, undo
    4  the new-region wizard end to end, and every rule it enforces
    4b B1: the province reaches every campaign that reads the map - a
       settlement, a music type, the lookup pair, a campaign's own record
       file and its own compiled map - and one undo takes all of it back
    5  every real map: a stroke, a re-encode and an undo
    6  the routes over real HTTP, a real save, and the Log's Undo
