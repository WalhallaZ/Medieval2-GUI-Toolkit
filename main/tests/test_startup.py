"""Startup: preflight checks, icon prewarm progress, and the two-process launch.

Covers:
  * every preflight check passes on a healthy install
  * each failure is reported, and only the ones that really block are fatal:
      - Pillow / web/index.html / unwritable config / old Python  -> fatal
      - MED2 root unset or moved                                  -> warning
      - port held by ANOTHER program -> fatal; held by OUR server -> warning
  * `report()` returns False only when something fatal failed
  * `prewarm_icons` converts on a cold cache, reuses on a warm one, tells the two
    apart in its progress, and stops when asked
  * a real detached launch: the launcher exits, the server outlives it, the log
    is mirrored, and STARTUP-COMPLETE is reached
  * a second launch reuses the running server instead of starting another - but
    only when it is the SAME build: another install's server on the port is
    reported, not reopened
  * the log falls back out of an unwritable config/ instead of vanishing
  * "did a browser really load?" is answered by the page heartbeat, not by
    webbrowser.open()'s unreliable Windows return value
