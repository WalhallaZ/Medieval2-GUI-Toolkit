"""Medieval 2 GUI Toolkit - launch the local web UI.

Usage:
  python app.py                 # use the remembered MED2 root (choose it in the UI if unset)
  python app.py <med2_root>     # set/point to the Medieval II install root (has a 'mods' folder)
  python app.py --port 9000
  python app.py --check         # run the startup checks and exit (no server)
  python app.py --serve         # run the server in THIS process (no launcher wrapper)
  python app.py --no-browser    # start the server but open no tab (scripts, tests, agents)

In Settings, "Open browser automatically" controls the same behaviour for
ordinary launcher runs.  When it is off, the launcher leaves its window open
with the local URL so it can be copied.

Startup, as the launcher does it:

  1. A console always opens, so a failed start is readable instead of a window
     that flashes and vanishes.
  2. The preflight checks run and print - Python, Pillow, web/, config/, the MED2
     root, the port. Anything fatal stops here with the reason on screen, and the
     launcher holds the window open.
  3. "Show console window" ON  -> the server runs right here: output keeps
     streaming and Ctrl+C stops it.
     "Show console window" OFF -> the server is started as a DETACHED child and
     this console mirrors its log (port, browser, TGA→PNG icon progress) until it
     reports ready, then exits and the window closes. The server keeps running;
     stop it with Quit in the UI.

The browser tab opens in the system DEFAULT browser - whatever Windows has
registered. The tool never picks a specific one.
