"""``descr_strat.txt``, write: characters, armies and the family tree.

16h wrote the half of a faction block that is places. This is the half that is
people: the general standing outside Nottingham with five regiments behind him,
the princess, the spy, the dead grandfather the game needs in order to draw a
family tree at all, and the ``relative`` line that says who was whose child.

It is built on 16h rather than beside it. :mod:`unittransfer.stratedit` owns the
discipline both records share - rewrite the line a field came from and keep its
indent and its comment, move a span rather than rebuild it, splice and then read
the whole file back to check what would be written - and every one of those
helpers is imported here rather than written again.

**What the file says, measured on all three installed campaigns.**

*A character block already ends on the blank line after it.* 16b closes a
character at the next thing that can only start something else, so its span runs
to the line before that: 216 of vanilla's 216 and 245 of Third Age Reforged's
246 end on a blank line, the one exception being the last character in a faction
block. A settlement needed :func:`~unittransfer.stratedit.detach_span` to pick
its separator up; a character carries its own, and moving one is therefore a
straight slice of ``[start, end]``.

*Nothing inside a faction block is indented.* Not the ``character`` line, not
``traits``, not one of the 1,678 ``unit`` lines measured. The comma separator on
a character line is ``", "`` on all 1,178 of vanilla's and all 1,422 of Third
Age Reforged's; on a ``traits`` line it is ``" , "`` on 388 of 389 and 513 of
513. The character line usually carries a trailing space - 215 of 216, 244 of
246 - which is why a new one is written in the shape of the line above it rather
than in a shape decided here.

**The bodyguard-first rule is vanilla's habit, not the engine's rule.** This was
going to be a refusal. Third Age Reforged has 213 characters with an army and
**only 14 of them hold a unit the EDU marks ``general_unit`` anywhere at all**,
never mind first; 199 lead armies with no bodyguard in them. The mod loads and
plays. Vanilla puts a bodyguard first on every general it has. So the rule is
reported as a warning with that number attached, and only when there is an
``export_descr_unit.txt`` on disk to say which units are bodyguards - which the
stock game, whose EDU is inside the packed data, does not have.

**And the attribute is what is read, never the name.** That mod calls 19 units
Bodyguard and gives ``general_unit`` to 6 of them: its Gondor, Arnor, Dunedain,
Lindon and Mithril Bodyguards are all ordinary regiments as far as the engine is
concerned. A check that went by the word would clear every one of those and
report nothing, which is worse than a check that does not run.

**The two family constraints are real and real files break them.** A living
parent should be at least sixteen years older than a child: vanilla breaks it
once (Egypt's Al-Zahir at 60 with Al-Mustansir at 45) and Third Age Reforged
once. Children should be listed oldest first: vanilla breaks it twice, on
Philip's four and Heinrich's three. Both are therefore warnings. Ages are only
comparable between the living - a dead ancestor's ``age`` is the age they died
at, not the age they would be now - so a ``dead`` record is left out of the
comparison rather than reported for it.

**Every faction with named characters has exactly one leader**, on all three
campaigns, and the exceptions hold none at all: the rebels in both of vanilla's
and Third Age Reforged's, and the prologue's Saxons. An heir is optional - seven
of Third Age Reforged's factions have a leader and no heir. Five of its factions
name two different characters the same thing, which matters because a
``relative`` line addresses people by name and nothing else.

**What is fatal is what the engine's own vocabulary has no room for**, which is
16h's ruling carried into a fourth phase: a character type that is not one of
the twelve, an age or a coordinate that is not a whole number, a tile off the
map, and a unit, trait or ancillary the mod's own file does not declare - that
last only when the file is on disk to say so. Everything else is a warning with
the count that made it one.
