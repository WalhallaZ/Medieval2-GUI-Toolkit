"""Parser + surgical editor for ``data/export_descr_buildings.txt`` (the EDB).

The EDB is the settlement-building database. It is a brace-nested tree of
*building lines* - a group of buildings that upgrade into one another::

    building cannon
    {
        convert_to castle_cannon
        levels gunsmith cannon_maker cannon_foundry royal_arsenal
        {
            gunsmith city requires factions { northern_european, } and event_counter gunpowder_discovered 1
            {
                convert_to 0
                capability
                {
                    recruit_pool "NE Bombard"  1  0.4  3  0  requires factions { england, }
                    armour 1
                }
                material wooden
                construction 3
                cost 800
                settlement_min city
                upgrades
                {
                    cannon_maker
                }
            }
            ...
        }
        plugins
        {
        }
    }

So the nesting is::

    building <line>            -> BuildingLine
      levels <a> <b> <c>       -> the upgrade order
      { <level> ... }          -> LevelBlock, one per name in `levels`
          capability { ... }   -> Capability lines (recruit_pool, armour, …)
          faction_capability { ... }
          upgrades { ... }     -> which level(s) this one upgrades into
      plugins <names> { ... }  -> Plugin (a legacy sub-building, no capabilities)

Non-destructive by construction
-------------------------------
Same rule as :mod:`unittransfer.sounds`: the file is kept as its **verbatim
lines** and every edit is a splice of a known line range. That matters more here
than anywhere else in the tool - Divide and Conquer's EDB is 17.5k lines whose
``recruit_pool`` lines carry hand-written trailing comments
(``;ok old_pool=2 new_pool=2 (Orc infantry T4 @ T5)``), the indentation mixes
tabs and spaces line by line, and a re-emitted file would lose all of it. Nothing
outside the spliced range is ever rewritten.

Localisation lives in ``data/text/export_buildings.txt``, which is the same
UTF-16 keyed format as ``export_units.txt`` but with ``_desc`` / ``_desc_short``
suffixes instead of ``_descr`` / ``_descr_short``.

    shows and what "⇄ Mirror" acts on can never disagree.

    A tier is a row of units, and every unit carries ``where``:

    ``both``
        trained on both sides. ``same`` then says whether the four numbers and
        the ``requires`` clause match as well, because a unit both sides train
        with different pools is a divergence the old mirror findings never
        reported at all.
    ``a`` / ``b``
