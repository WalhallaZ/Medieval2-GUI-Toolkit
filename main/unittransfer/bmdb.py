"""Mod-wide battle_models.modeldb tools - the third mode of the app.

:mod:`unittransfer.edit` edits the modeldb entries *one unit* points at. This
module works on the file as a whole:

  * **browse / edit every entry**, not just a unit's - the payload it hands the
    UI is exactly the one the unit editor's model card renders
    (:func:`unittransfer.edit.model_payload`), and edits are planned by
    :func:`unittransfer.edit.plan_bmdb`, so both modes share one engine;
  * **audit** the file: which entries nothing references any more, which entries
    exist only because a unit's ``soldier`` line names them (and could be pointed
    at an existing twin instead), and which files under ``data/unit_models`` no
    entry mentions at all;
  * **clean up**: drop those entries from the mod's modeldb and *move* their
    files out into a folder of the user's choosing, mirroring the mod's own
    layout so the whole thing can be dropped back in later. That folder also gets
    a standalone modeldb holding only the removed entries;
  * **drop dead mounts**: a ``descr_mount.txt`` definition no unit rides is a
    modeldb entry held alive by nothing, so removing the mount is usually what
    makes its model removable. Opt-in, and the removed blocks are exported too.

Why it matters: M2TW loads the entire modeldb into memory and big overhauls sit
near the engine's limits, so entries and meshes that nothing references cost real
budget. Nothing is deleted outright - everything moves to the export folder and
every touched file is backed up, so 🕑 Log → Undo restores the mod exactly.

What counts as "referenced":
  * ``export_descr_unit.txt`` - ``soldier`` / ``officer`` / ``armour_ug_models``
  * ``descr_mount.txt`` - a mount's model
  * ``descr_character.txt`` - ``battle_model`` (generals, agents)
  * every campaign and battle script in the mod - ``descr_strat.txt``,
    ``campaign_script.txt`` and ``descr_battle.txt``, wherever they live:
    ``battle_model`` again, but written inline in a comma-separated character
    line rather than on its own, so those get a looser pattern - *and*
    ``change_battle_model <faction> <who> <model>``, the script command that
    swaps a character's model mid-campaign and puts the model last. See
    :func:`script_models`. The whole mod
    root is walked for them rather than the campaign folder, because a custom
    campaign sits a folder deeper, a custom battle sits on another tree entirely,
    and an installer's ``Activate/`` or ``extra/`` copy becomes the live mod the
    moment somebody runs the mod's own switcher. See :func:`campaign_files`.
  * **every ``.lua`` script in the mod** - M2TWEOP mods create units, swap models
    and spawn characters from Lua, and none of that is written down in any
    ``.txt``. Any entry name a script mentions is off limits; see
    :mod:`unittransfer.luascan`.
  * anything else: any ``data/descr_*.txt`` that merely *mentions* the name is
    treated as a reference too, bar the two in :data:`DESCR_SKIP` that cannot
    name a battle model at all. That is deliberately over-cautious - a false
    "still used" costs nothing, a false "unused" silently breaks a mod.

And when the nets were not wide enough - which is a thing that is only ever
discovered afterwards, with the mod already crashing - :func:`recheck` reads the
cleanup log back, re-tests everything past runs removed against the nets above as
they stand *today*, and reports what should not have gone and whether a copy of it
still exists to put back. :func:`revert_recheck` does the putting back.

    is the single way a referenced entry may still be dropped - so the pairings
    are worked out per footer group rather than one entry at a time. When a group
    has somewhere safe to land the whole group can go; when it does not, one
    member is held back to be the entry the others point at.

# faction skin coverage - "fix ownership"


#: The two answers to "which factions should this entry have a skin for".
#:
#: ``units`` is the honest one: an entry needs a record for every faction that
#: can actually field a unit drawn with it, which is the union of those units'
#: ``ownership`` lines. ``all`` is the blunt one a modder reaches for when a
#: model is meant to be usable by anybody - every faction slot in the roster.

    ``slave`` is included on purpose: it is a real texture record (the generic
    rebel skin) and a rebel unit whose entry has none is exactly the gap this is
    for. What is NOT included is an ownership token the faction roster does not

      overwrite a real one by accident.

  data\\...
      The mesh / texture / sprite files those entries used, in the same layout
      they had inside the mod. To put them back, copy this "data" folder over
      the mod's own data folder and paste the entries from {db} back into the
      mod's battle_models.modeldb (and fix the entry count in its header line).

  {unused}\\data\\...
      Files that were sitting under data\\unit_models but were not named by ANY
      entry in the modeldb, removed or kept. Nothing referenced them.

  {mounts}
      The {nm} descr_mount.txt block(s) that were removed, verbatim. No unit in the
      mod had a "mount" line naming them. Paste them back into data\\descr_mount.txt
      to restore them.

Undo: the removal itself is in the tool's log (the clock button) - "Undo" puts
every removed file and the original modeldb / export_descr_unit.txt back. This
folder is a copy and is never touched by Undo, so it is safe to keep or delete.

# answers the question that only comes up afterwards, usually with the game
# already crashing: *the last cleanup ran with a narrower idea of what counts as
# a reference than the one this build has - did it take something out that today
# it would refuse to touch?*
#
# It is deliberately a separate pass rather than part of `audit`. The audit
# describes the mod as it is now; a file that is gone is not in the mod to be
# described, and the only surviving record that it ever existed is the cleanup's
# own log entry. So this reads the log, re-derives what each run removed, re-tests
# every one of those against the current (wider) nets, and then answers the
# practical question: can it be put back, and from where.
