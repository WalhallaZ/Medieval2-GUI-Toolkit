        The lookup below has to be case-insensitive (a card named ``#Foo.tga``
        for a dictionary of ``foo`` is common, and Linux would miss it), and it
        used to get that by globbing the whole faction folder per extension per
        candidate faction. Building the list of a mod's unit cards then cost
        **224,712 globs** and 4.8 of the 4.9 seconds it took to answer
        ``/api/units`` for Divide and Conquer - the visible half of "switching
        mods doesn't switch the units".

        One listing per folder replaces all of it. The folder's mtime is the
        key, so a card that appears while the tool is running is still picked up:
        adding or removing a file changes the folder's mtime, and the next
        lookup re-lists it.

        ...except that "changes the folder's mtime" is only true to the
        filesystem's own resolution, which is the one thing that stamp cannot
        tell you about itself. Two changes inside one tick of it land on the SAME
        mtime, and then the cache is served for a folder that no longer looks
        like that. Measured on NTFS here: replacing a file in place (unlink, then
        create under a different name) left the folder's mtime untouched in
        **70 of 2000 rounds - 3.5%**, and every one of those is a unit card the
        tool then reports as missing.

        So an entry listed while its folder's mtime was still inside that window
        is marked *racy* and re-listed next time, which is the rule git uses for
        exactly this problem ("racily clean" index entries). It costs one extra
        listing per lookup, but only for a folder something wrote to within the
        last :data:`_MTIME_GRAIN_NS`; a folder that has been sitting still - which
        is every folder, during the bulk lookup this index exists to make fast -
        is answered from the cache as before.
