title Medieval 2 GUI Toolkit

rem Launch the Medieval 2 GUI Toolkit. Runs from this file's own folder, so it works
rem no matter where the shortcut is invoked from. Any arguments (e.g. a MED2 root
rem path, or "--port 9000") are passed straight through to app.py.
rem
rem Two layouts, one file. In the repository the code lives in main\ and only this
rem launcher, Install-Dependencies.bat and the README sit beside it; in the release
rem zip everything is unpacked flat and app.py is right here. So look for main\app.py
rem and work from wherever app.py actually is - the same copy of this file is what
rem the build puts in the zip, and it has to be right in both.
cd /d "%~dp0"
if exist "main\app.py" cd /d "%~dp0main"

rem This window ALWAYS opens, so a failed start is readable instead of a console
rem that flashes and vanishes. app.py prints its startup checks and the unit-card
rem TGA->PNG conversion progress here, then:
rem   "Show console window" OFF (default) -> it starts the server as a detached
rem      process and this window closes on its own once the server is up.
rem   "Show console window" ON  -> the server runs in this window; Ctrl+C stops it.
rem Either way, an error keeps the window open with the reason in it.
