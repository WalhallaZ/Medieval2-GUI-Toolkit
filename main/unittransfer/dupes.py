"""Entries ``battle_models.modeldb`` lists more than once.

A modeldb is a flat stream of entry blocks, and nothing in the format stops the
same name appearing twice. Real mods are full of it: an entry gets pasted in
again during a merge, a submod ships its own copy of a model the base mod
already had, a name gets reused for a model that was meant to replace the first
one. Third Age Reforged has eight such names, Divide and Conquer five.

**The game reads the first block with a name and ignores every later one.** A
unit that names the model gets the first block's meshes, the first block's
skins and the first block's animations; the second block is bytes the engine
walks past. That is what makes this worth a screen of its own rather than a
line in the cleanup dialog: a modder who pasted a fixed model in at the bottom
of the file is looking at a mod that does not use it and no error anywhere
saying so.

So there are exactly two useful things to do with a block that is not the first
of its name, and this module plans and applies both:

``rename``
    Give it a name of its own. The block stops being dead and becomes a real
    entry that a unit can be pointed at. Nothing references the new name yet,
    which the plan says out loud so it does not read as a finished job.

``remove``
    Drop the block. When it is byte-identical to the first one this loses
    nothing at all; when it differs, it discards a model, so the plan spells
    out what was different before anything is written.

The first block of a name is never touched by either. It is the one the game
actually reads, and every reference in the mod resolves to it, so removing or
renaming it would change what units draw with. Everything here is keyed by the
block's index in :attr:`ModelDb.entries` rather than by name, because a name is
exactly the thing these blocks do not have to themselves.

This is deliberately not part of :mod:`unittransfer.bmdb`'s cleanup. That one
answers "is anything still using this?" and moves assets out of the mod; this
one never touches a file on disk other than the modeldb itself, and its
question is the opposite - the entries here are ones the mod may well want, it
just cannot reach them.
