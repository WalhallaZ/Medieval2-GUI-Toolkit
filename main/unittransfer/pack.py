"""Unit packs: units in a zip you can hand to someone else.

The problem this solves is not "copy a unit" - :mod:`unittransfer.transfer`
already does that, and does it well: it resolves name collisions, follows armour
upgrades, brings the mount and its animation set, renames colliding projectiles,
fixes ownership and puts every touched file in the undo log. The problem is that
all of that only works when *both* mods are on the same machine.

So a pack is not a new format the importer has to understand. **A pack is a
mod.** The zip holds a real ``data/`` tree - an EDU with just those units, a
modeldb with just their entries, their meshes, textures, icons, voice lines and
whatever ``descr_*`` blocks they name - and importing one unzips it and hands it
to :func:`unittransfer.transfer.plan_transfer` as an ordinary source mod.

That is the whole design. Every check a normal transfer makes, a pack import
makes too, because it *is* a normal transfer; there is no second code path to
keep in step, and a pack built by an older version of the tool stays importable
for as long as the tool can read a mod at all.

What travels:

  ``unitpack.json``    which units, from which mod, when, by which version
  ``data/…``           the mini-mod, laid out exactly as a real one

What deliberately does not: anything the receiving mod already has to decide for
itself. A pack carries no ownership rewrites, no building recruit pools and no
opinion about which faction should field the unit - those are the importer's
options, and they are asked on the way in.

This zip is a miniature mod: everything under "data" is laid out exactly as a

the units in, and use "Import a unit pack" - the import runs the same checks,
conflict handling and options a normal transfer does, and lands in the same undo
log.

You do not have to use the tool. Unzipping this over a mod would technically put
the files in the right places, but the text files here hold ONLY these units, so
copying them over a real mod's export_descr_unit.txt or battle_models.modeldb
